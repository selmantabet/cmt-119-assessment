    <p align="justify" class="article-p">
      Dennis MacAlistair Ritchie, born in Bonxville, NY on September 9, 1941 to Alistair and Jean McGee Ritchie. He was a computer scientist who is most known for his work on the development of the C language. And along with Ken Thompson, he is also known as one of the people behind the creation of the UNIX system and the standard that it spawned. He has a background in applied mathematics and physics from Harvard University and started a career at Bell Labs’ Computing Sciences Research Center in 1967. <a href="#WorldBio" style="display: contents;" class="citation-button">(Encyclopedia of World Biography, n.d.)</a> For his contribution to the field of computing, he was awarded the Turing Award, Hamming Medal, as well as the National Medal of Technology and Japan Prize, all jointly received with Ken Thompson. <a href="#CHM" style="display: contents;" class="citation-button">(Computer History Museum, n.d.)</a>

      Ritchie’s first work notable work was on the Multics timesharing system developed jointly by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Labs, and General Electric. The system would allow the processing of thousands of users simultaneously, akin to parallel processing. When the project was dropped by Bell Labs, Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie were left behind with the motive for the creation of UNIX, a simpler operating system than the original Multics, which would work well on the minicomputers that were on the rise, such as DEC’s PDP series. <a href="#Campbell" style="display: contents;" class="citation-button">(Campbell-Kelly, 2011)</a> <a href="#Hosch" style="display: contents;" class="citation-button">(Hosch, 2022)</a>

      The original UNIX was fully written in machine code, which proved to be lengthy and expensive, and the end result was a system that has a source tied to a specific type of machine, i.e. lacks portability. Machine code is tied to instruction sets, and not all computers are built to work on the same instruction sets across the board. One instruction from a given set won’t be decoded (understood) correctly by a system working with a completely different instruction set. <a href="#Kirvan" style="display: contents;" class="citation-button">(Kirvan, 2022)</a>
    </p>
    <p align="justify" class="article-p">
      This lack of portability in their UNIX system was the catalyst behind the creation of the C language by the two developers, a way to bridge the gap between the different machines under a single language. This brings the language abstraction level one layer above the machine (to something somewhat more readable to developers) and allows for a compiler to do the heavy lifting to translate C language logic into machine code instructions. <a href="#WorldBio" style="display: contents;" class="citation-button">(Encyclopedia of World Biography, n.d.)</a> <a href="#Bloom" style="display: contents;" class="citation-button">(Bloom, 2021)</a> The C Programming Language was the book that Dennis Ritchie and Brian Kernighan (collectively under the name of K&R, for Kernighan & Ritchie) wrote to document the C language. The book is still widely used to this day in programming education. <a href="#Perlow" style="display: contents;" class="citation-button">(Perlow, 2011)</a>

      He died on October 12th, 2011, having been in a frail state after going through several rounds of treatment for prostate cancer and heart disease in his late years. <a href="#Lohr" style="display: contents;" class="citation-button">(Lohr, 2011)</a> His death did not receive much attention as the news were overshadowed in the media by the death of Steve Jobs the week prior. <a href="#Srinivasan" style="display: contents;" class="citation-button">(Srinivasan, 2011)</a> One does not need to look far into computers to find Ritchie’s legacy. High-performing operating systems still use C, and the languages that spawned afterward are heavily influenced by C, in one way or another. <a href="#CCH" style="display: contents;" class="citation-button">(Centre for Computing History, n.d.)</a> <a href="#Gallagher" style="display: contents;" class="citation-button">(Gallagher, 2011)</a> And UNIX-like systems that were created during the advent of the Free Software Movement, such as Linux and FreeBSD, will always have Dennis to thank for.
