      Throughout this course, I have managed to learn more about the basics of HTML and CSS, and the whole process took me well over 10 years back, back to when I did my IGCSEs/O-Levels. I learned MS FrontPage in 2008, my very first WYSIWYG sort of tool, where much of the HTML editing was done through GUIs (using buttons and forms). Revisiting HTML and CSS after all this time was a bit of a change of pace from my previous extensive studies in firmware and register-level programming. My HTML knowledge was only kept refreshed throughout the years through the occasional element inspection on some pages, especially when I would change some content on a page for humorous purposes, such as changing a grade on an online transcript, or a social media post from someone I know.

      At the start of the module, I was under the impression that it would merely be a review of the basics that I have learned throughout the FrontPage days. But soon enough I realized that there were a bunch of things I still did not cover because they were not pushed in the older iterations of HTML and CSS that I used. I ended up learning more about CSS specificity and responsive web design, which includes elements such as flex boxes and grids. Using this newfound knowledge of CSS, I could embed custom snippets of CSS in the websites that I develop, in the unlikely scenario that no tool already included a satisfactory CSS design spec. I also went the extra mile in learning about media queries, built-in math functions, and animating objects in CSS.

      Even though I learned a lot about HTML and CSS. I will keep on building <a href="https://selman.io/" class="button" style="display: contents;">my site</a> using content management systems like Squarespace and WordPress since they produce a higher quality product than anything I could ever reasonably develop alone with HTML and CSS in a relatively short period of time.

      Moreover, the course included some fundamental material that examined the concept of Computational Thinking. Much of it has been things that I have personally done well before I even started programming. Having it laid out to me through instructional material has put a name, a label, on the very thing my brain has been doing all this time, from solving day-to-day problems to programming complex backend systems.

      I still do wonder why Computational Thinking and HTML/CSS have been mushed together into one course. To me, HTML and CSS feel out of place in the context of computational thinking as there isn’t as much overlap. Computational thinking should instead be an introductory part of the main CMT120 Programming course since that is the course where Computational Thinking is more heavily used. That’s where true problem-solving skills are tested, HTML and CSS do not test one’s knowledge in algorithm design and abstraction. HTML is a markup language after all (it’s in the name), it forms a document and does not contain any logic (script elements do not count, they use a different engine). Point being; <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/145179" style="display: contents;" class="button">HTML is not a programming language</a>, yet Dr. Morgan begs to differ. It's probably one of those bits that are still debated to this day.
